# aw-comp-challenge-3
Third Static Comp Challenge

This was quite a lot of work and with more time, I would have loved to have been able to make it more interactive than it already is. In the end though, I learned a lot from this project. I used an API for the first time, learned how to set hover states more dynamically through css and used javascript to make a media query work.
